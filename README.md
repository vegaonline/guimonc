# MONCGUI - a graphical user interface for MONC code
# Abhijit Bhattacharyya
 This is developed using JAVAFX for the frontend where one may
 create configuration space followed by the Geometry.
 Then one may run the MONC code to run using the config file.
 Lastly one may plot data.

 Triangular mesh based geometry is in use. Bricks, cylinder and sphere 
 are three main geometries while cylinder could be annular and may have
 starting angle and ending angle to make partial annular cylinder. For sphere
 one may have annular sphere with selection of starting and ending angles for 
 theta and phi to correspond vertical and azimuthal angles.

 Material databased has been made using NIST element and compounds. Compounds
 have number of atomic components and their corresponding atomic fraction.

Graphics in 3D has been tried using jzy3D with BSD licence https://github.com/jzy3d/jzy3d-api vide home page http://www.jzy3d.org .



# It is under development.
