# MONCGUI - a graphical user interface for MONC code
# Abhijit Bhattacharyya
 This is developed using JAVAFX for the frontend where one may
 create configuration space followed by the Geometry.
 Then one may run the MONC code to run using the config file.
 Lastly one may plot data.

Solid geometry was working while presently triangular mesh
based geometry has to be made. 

It is under development.
